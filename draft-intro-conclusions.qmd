Discussion

In order to answer the reasearch question, "What are the risks associated with warm water used for reactor cooling at the Dauphin Island Nuclear Power Plant?", we must analyze the data we collected above. The reactor at Dauphin Island is designed to use seawater during the cooling process. To do so, it collects sea water to pump through the reactor in order to transfer energy away from the reactor and into the water, warming it. Warmer water cannot have as much thermal energy transferred into it as cooler water, and therefore cannot generate as much power [@cooling]. It is also important to note that there are environmental factors to be considered. A power plant releasing heated water back into its surroundings can disrupt the ecological balance, killing or disrupting the plants and animals in the area. Due to the potential risks and NRC regulations, once the water temperature surrounding the plant reaches 85 degrees F, the plant must reduce all operations to 50% for the next 24 hours. In our data collection, we found 94 days in 2024 would have had to reduce operations at the Power Plant. By cutting power on 25.68% of the days, the surrounding areas that rely on the plant for power are now looking at losing power or having to drastically cut down on their electricity usage.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 33% of the electricity used in Alabama in 2023 was generated by the two nuclear power plants in the state [@u.s.ene]. Just one of the two operating at half capacity would have a detrimental effect on consumer energy use in the state. Residents would have to operate without certainty of when they'd have power, fearful of outages and relying on generators during the summer months. Essential businesses such as hospitals, grocery stores, and pharmacies will take precedent, likely not losing power completely, but possibly having to cut down on electrical usage.

Throughout the data collection process, !!!!!!!!!! Despite using multiple years of data collected by the NOAA, our data is incomplete. This may lead to an underestimation in our analysis and understatement of our data and results. Every day of the year has multiple observations, which at least gives us a clear picture of how the water temperature changes off the coast of Dauphin Island.

Relation

Broader Interpretation

This use of water to cool nuclear power plants is not just exclusive to Dauphin Island, Alabama, or even the United States. Worldwide, this same system is used. No

Prospects

Despite the research we've done on the topic,
