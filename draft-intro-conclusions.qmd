Intro

Nuclear power is growing rapidly. As a clean resource, it is generally seen as a positive alternative to fossil fuels. When all precautions are taken, it is better for the environment and safer than many other energy options according to the Nuclear Energy Institute [@whatis].

Discussion

In order to answer the reasearch question, "What are the risks associated with warm water used for reactor cooling at the Dauphin Island Nuclear Power Plant?", we must analyze the data we collected above. The reactor at Dauphin Island is designed to use seawater during the cooling process. To do so, it collects sea water to pump through the reactor in order to transfer energy away from the reactor and into the water, warming it. Warmer water cannot have as much thermal energy transferred into it as cooler water, and therefore cannot generate as much power [@cooling]. It is also important to note that there are environmental factors to be considered. A power plant releasing heated water back into its surroundings can disrupt the ecological balance, killing or disrupting the plants and animals in the area. Due to the potential risks and NRC regulations, once the water temperature surrounding the plant reaches 85 degrees F, the plant must reduce all operations to 50% for the next 24 hours. In our data collection, we found 94 days in 2024 would have had to reduce operations at the Power Plant. By cutting power on 25.68% of the days, the surrounding areas that rely on the plant for power are now looking at losing power or having to drastically cut down on their electricity usage.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 33% of the electricity used in Alabama in 2023 was generated by the two nuclear power plants in the state [@u.s.ene]. Just one of the two operating at half capacity would have a detrimental effect on consumer energy use in the state. Residents would have to operate without certainty of when they'd have power, fearful of outages and relying on generators during the summer months. Essential businesses such as hospitals, grocery stores, and pharmacies will take precedent, likely not losing power completely, but possibly having to cut down on electrical usage.

Throughout the data collection process, we did our best to reduce any potential error. Despite using multiple years of data collected by the NOAA, our data is incomplete. This may lead to an underestimation in our analysis and understatement of our data and results. Every day of the year has multiple observations, which at least gives us a clear picture of how the water temperature changes daily off the coast of Dauphin Island. The collection of a complete data set would be beneficial to the analysis and interpretation of our results.

It may also be useful to our analysis finding exact data on electricity output and usage over the last decade in Alabama. For the purposes of this paper, we did not find it to be necessary that we use exact data. Instead, we cited data from the United States Energy Information Administration and the World Nuclear Association to make claims and analyses.

We build

This use of water to cool nuclear power plants is not just exclusive to Dauphin Island, Alabama, or even the United States. Worldwide, this same system is used. Different countries or regions may have different guidelines on ideal water temperature, but the idea and consequences are the same. For example, the World Nuclear Association writes about the Brown's Ferry Nuclear Power Plant in Northern Alabama, "In mid 2010, TVA had to reduce power at its three Brown's Ferry Units in Alabama to 50% in order to keep river water temperatures below 32 degrees C, at a cost to some \$50 million to customers" [@cooling]. Worldwide, almost 10% of all energy used comes from the 440 nuclear power plants across the globe [@nuclear]. The World Nuclear Association states that some countries like France, Hungary, or Ukraine, rely on nuclear energy for more than half of their electricity. In these cases, the threat of operating at half capacity is more daunting, as it can effect much of a country's power output.

Despite the research we've done on the topic, there are multiple opportunities to build on the knowledge we've gained. Using local and national guidelines, you can research the probability of partial shutdowns at any nuclear power plant across the world. It may be particularly helpful to research France's nuclear power plants as they supply over 70% of the country's power. A major heat wave and increase in surrounding water temperatures could lead to ruinous power outages across the country. Researching the probability of these outages and the effects they could have is a great first step to mitigating a country-wide disaster.

Due to increasing concern for the effects of climate change on environments, we would also recommend further research be done on how the Dauphin Island power plant may be effected. If water temperature is increasing on average year-over-year, the power plant could be at risk for longer periods of working at 50% capacity, further straining power supplies in Alabama. Prevention and alleviation tactics would be the best focuses of future study.

Finally, alternative water sources or water cooling systems could help ease the stress on nuclear power plants. The use of groundwater is an intriguing topic, but its slow replenishment could lead to future resource issues. Rapid cooling of sea water is another interesting idea, but trade offs must be studied to find the feasibility of this idea.
