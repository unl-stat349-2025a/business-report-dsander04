# Introduction

There are many well-known risks involved with nuclear power generation, one of those being overheating of water used in the reactor cooling system. This is what is being studied at the Dauphin Island Nuclear Power Plant on Dauphin Island in Alabama. What is the risk of the "cooling water" getting too hot for the plant to operate at full capacity? We also want to understand the potential consequences of the water being too hot. Could elevated water temperature harm the surrounding environment? Would Alabama's power grid struggle to maintain power levels? How could any of these negative results be minimized or prevented?

Multiple studies have found increased water temperature to be detrimental to the operation of nuclear power plants across the world. The World Nuclear Organization details multiple accounts of this happening in their article on cooling power plants. They say they had to operate three reactors at 50% capacity at the Brown's Ferry plant in Alabama to ensure river water temperatures didn't exceed 89.6°F [@Cooling2020]. In France, the Rhine and Neckar river temperatures approached 82.4°F, so government officials threatened to temporarily close the reactors on those rivers. A unit within a nuclear plant in Connecticut was even closed permanently because Long Island Sound seawater temperatures continually exceeded 75.2°F. These examples give us good insight into what is to be expected when water temperatures get too high. However, we want to know about the Dauphin Island plant off the southern coast of Alabama. There is little to no information about nuclear power stations in the area that use seawater to cool the reactors, so we hope to fill in that gap and find the risk of a partial shutdown.

Using data from weather stations in the area, we analyzed the probability of the Dauphin Island plant having to reduce their operations due to increased cooling water. Our findings indicated most summer days reach a temperature above the guideline, forcing our plant to reduce operations to half of what is normally expected. Generated 95 percent confidence intervals suggest there will be a minimum of 30 days worth of shutdowns for each of the next five years, with the potential for up to 170 days. We also found nuclear power to be a large source of power in Alabama, leading to potential power outages if the plant were to be forced to function at 50 percent output.
