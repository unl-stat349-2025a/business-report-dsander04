# Introduction

There are many well-known risks involved with nuclear power generation, one of which is overheating of water used in the reactor cooling system. This is what is being studied at the Dauphin Island Nuclear Power Plant located on Dauphin Island in Alabama. What is the risk of the "cooling water" getting too hot for the plant to operate at full capacity? We also aim to understand the potential consequences of elevated water temperature. Could this heightened water temperature harm the surrounding environment? Would Alabama's power grid struggle to maintain power levels? How could any of these negative results be minimized or prevented?

Multiple studies have found increased water temperatures to be detrimental to the operation of nuclear power plants across the world. The World Nuclear Organization details multiple accounts of this happening in their article on cooling power plants. For instance, they reported that three reactors had to operate at 50% capacity at the Brown's Ferry plant in Alabama to ensure river water temperatures didn't exceed 89.6°F [@Cooling2020]. In France, the Rhine and Neckar river temperatures approached 82.4°F, so government officials threatened to temporarily close the reactors on those rivers. A unit within a nuclear plant in Connecticut was even closed permanently because Long Island Sound seawater temperatures continually exceeded 75.2°F. These examples offer valuable insight into what is to be expected when water temperatures get too high. However, we want to know about the Dauphin Island plant off the southern coast of Alabama. There is little to no information about nuclear power stations in the area that use seawater to cool the reactors, so we hope to fill in that gap and find the risk of a partial shutdown.

Using data from weather stations in the area, we analyzed the probability that the Dauphin Island plant will need to reduce their operations due to increased cooling water. Our findings indicate that most summer days reach a temperature above the guideline, forcing our plant to reduce operations to half of what is normally expected. Generated 95 percent confidence intervals suggest there will be a minimum of 30 days worth of shutdowns for each of the next five years, with the potential for up to 170 days. We also found nuclear power to be a major energy source in Alabama, leading to potential power outages if the plant were to be forced to function at 50 percent output.
